# 03. Governance & Compliance

## Standards Governance Model

The OpenAPI AI Agents Standard operates as the "Switzerland of AI Agents" - maintaining strict neutrality between competing protocols while providing the enterprise compliance framework that makes adoption NECESSARY, not optional. Our governance model ensures both vendor neutrality and enterprise-grade reliability.
