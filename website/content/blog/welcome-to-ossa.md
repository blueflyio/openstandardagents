# Welcome to OSSA

We're excited to announce the release of **OSSA (Open Standard for Scalable AI Agents)** - the OpenAPI for AI Agents.

## What is OSSA?

OSSA is a specification standard for defining AI agents, similar to how OpenAPI standardizes REST APIs. Just as OpenAPI enables API interoperability, OSSA enables agent interoperability across frameworks, runtimes, and organizations.

## Key Features

- **Framework-agnostic** - Works with any LLM framework
- **Portable** - Move agents between teams and organizations
- **Validatable** - JSON Schema validation ensures correctness
- **No vendor lock-in** - Deploy to any infrastructure

## Get Started

Install the OSSA CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @openstandardagents/cli
```

Create your first agent:

```bash
osa init my-agent --type worker
```
