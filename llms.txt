# Open Standard for Scalable Agents (OSSA)

> OSSA is a vendor-neutral, open specification for defining, deploying, and orchestrating AI agents across platforms. It provides a standardized schema for agent capabilities, triggers, outputs, and lifecycle management integrated with GitLab Ultimate and Duo Platform.

Key features:
- Vendor-neutral agent definitions using YAML schemas
- GitLab Duo Platform integration with 12 specialized agents
- Kubernetes-native deployment with GitOps
- Multi-agent orchestration with meta-orchestrator
- Self-healing automation across 8 healing agents
- AgentFlow lifecycle with custom fields
- Semantic versioning and milestone-driven releases

## Core Specification

- [OSSA Schema v0.2.8](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/blob/main/spec/ossa-schema.yaml): Complete agent definition schema with capabilities, triggers, and outputs
- [AgentFlow Lifecycle](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/wikis/AgentFlow-Lifecycle): 9-state workflow (Triage → To Do → In Progress → Done/Canceled)
- [Custom Fields](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/wikis/Custom-Field-Enforcement): 8 fields for agent coordination (agent_assigned, agent_status, commit_type, priority, release_type)
- [Bot Waves](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/wikis/Specialized-Bot-Deployment): 5-wave orchestration model for parallel agent execution

## Agents

- [12 OSSA Agents Registry](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/wikis/Specialized-Bot-Deployment): Canonical list (wiki-aggregator, ts-prod, ts-local, ossa-local, native-local, ml-prod, ml-local, infra-prod, gitlab-lib-ci, gitlab-lib-local, drupal-prod, drupal-local)
- [Meta-Orchestrator](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/83): Agent that manages all other agents with routing logic and wave coordination
- [Wiki Healer](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/75): Autonomous documentation agent with continuous wiki sync
- [Security Healer](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/82): Vulnerability scanning with SAST, DAST, dependency, secret, and container scanning
- [Test Generator](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/81): Coverage-driven test generation with property-based testing

## Integration

- [GitLab Duo Platform](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/73): Complete integration with Issue-to-MR flow, Software Development flow, and Security Analyst
- [AutoDevOps](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/autodevops/): Auto Build, Test, Deploy, Security scanning, Review Apps, and Release Evidence
- [Release Automation](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/74): Milestone-driven releases with semantic versioning and changelog generation
- [Repository Audit](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/84): Automated compliance checks across 10 categories

## Examples

- [OSSA Schema Examples](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/tree/main/examples): 35+ example agent definitions
- [Healing Agents](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/tree/main/schemas): 8 self-healing agent schemas (wiki, architecture, spec, infra, dependency, service-discovery, test, security)
- [GitLab Components](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/agent-platform/gitlab_components): Reusable CI/CD components for agent workflows

## Optional

- [Buildkit Integration](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/wikis/Buildkit): Task queue orchestration with claim, heartbeat, and release commands
- [Compliance Profiles](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/71): FedRAMP, SOC2, ISO42001 compliance specifications
- [Type System](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/70): Formal OSSA type system specification
- [Testing Framework](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/-/issues/72): AgentTest resource for agent validation
