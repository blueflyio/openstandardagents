# 🚀 Level 0: Minimal Agent Example

The absolute minimum OSSA agent configuration. Just enough to be discovered by workspace discovery.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Validate the agent
ossa validate agent.yml

# This minimal agent can be discovered but provides basic metadata only
```

## What This Shows

- **7 lines**: Minimal OSSA v0.1.8 compliance
- **Discovery Ready**: Can be found by workspace discovery
- **Core Tier**: Basic conformance tier
- **General Purpose**: Most common agent class

## Next Steps

→ **Level 1**: `01-agent-basic/` - Add framework compatibility and detailed capabilities
