## Security Considerations

⚠️ **WARNING**: Reports may contain references to sensitive files and security vulnerabilities.

- Reports are automatically created with restricted permissions (600)
- Never commit reports containing credential findings to version control
- Archive old reports regularly to maintain security
- Review reports for sensitive information before sharing

## Retention Policy

- **Active Reports**: 90 days in main directory
- **Archived Reports**: 1 year in archive directory  
- **Security Reports**: Permanent retention in secure storage
- **Cleanup Plans**: 30 days (execution dependent)

## Automated Cleanup

The auditor agent includes automated report management:

```bash
# Clean old reports (>90 days)
ossa-auditor cleanup-reports --older-than 90d

# Archive reports by date
ossa-auditor archive-reports --before 2025-06-01

# Secure delete sensitive reports
ossa-auditor secure-delete-reports --pattern "*credential*"
```
