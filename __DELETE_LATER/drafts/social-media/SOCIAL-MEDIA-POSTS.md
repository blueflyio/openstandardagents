# Social Media Posts for OSSA Article

## Medium Comment/Post

I just published an article on the latest release and vision of OSSA (Open Standard for Software Agents).

The AI agent ecosystem is fragmented—just like REST APIs were before OpenAPI. Google ADK, OpenAI Agents, Anthropic MCP, and Microsoft AutoGen each define incompatible formats, creating vendor lock-in and preventing true interoperability.

OSSA solves this by providing a vendor-neutral specification that enables agents to run across 17+ frameworks without rewrites. One manifest, many runtimes—just like OpenAPI did for REST APIs.

Key highlights:
✅ Transport-agnostic contracts (HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, MCP, A2A)
✅ Deterministic state management
✅ Enterprise compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, SOC2)
✅ Security scopes for least-privilege access
✅ Progressive adoption tiers

Check out the full article to see how OSSA is becoming the OpenAPI for AI agents.

## LinkedIn Post (Longer Form)

I just published an article on OSSA (Open Standard for Software Agents) and why standardization matters for the AI agent ecosystem.

The problem: We're seeing the same fragmentation that plagued early REST APIs. Google ADK, OpenAI Agents, Anthropic MCP, and Microsoft AutoGen each define incompatible agent formats, creating vendor lock-in and preventing interoperability.

The solution: OSSA provides a vendor-neutral, enterprise-grade specification that enables agents to run across 17+ frameworks without translation drift. One standardized manifest, many runtimes—exactly what OpenAPI did for REST APIs.

What makes OSSA different:
• Transport-agnostic contracts supporting HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, MCP, and A2A
• Formalized state management modes (stateless, session, long_running)
• OAuth-style security scopes for granular permissions
• Native compliance tagging (HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP, SOC2)
• Progressive adoption tiers from core to advanced

As someone who's worked in enterprise architecture for 23+ years (including senior roles at Acquia and GitLab), I've seen firsthand how standards drive adoption. OSSA is Apache 2.0 licensed and open for contributions.

Read the full article to learn how OSSA is closing the gap left by proprietary runtimes and aligning with emerging industry governance requirements.

## Twitter/X Post (Short)

Just published: "An OpenAPI for AI Agents" 🚀

The AI agent ecosystem is fragmented—Google ADK, OpenAI Agents, Anthropic MCP, AutoGen all incompatible formats.

OSSA solves this: one vendor-neutral spec, runs across 17+ frameworks, zero rewrites.

✅ Transport-agnostic
✅ Enterprise compliance (HIPAA, GDPR, FedRAMP)
✅ Security scopes
✅ Progressive adoption

The OpenAPI for AI agents.
