## Executive Summary

The AI agent landscape is fragmented with **no standardization**. Every company defines "agent" differently. This document maps **all major platforms** to ensure OSSA provides comprehensive interoperability.

**Key Findings:**
- **100+ platforms** identified across 7 categories
- **No universal standard** exists (OSSA aims to fill this gap)
- **79% of enterprises** report AI agent adoption (2025)
- **Market growth**: 35-46% CAGR through 2030
