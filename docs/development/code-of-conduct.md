# OpenAPI AI Agents Standard - Code of Conduct

> **Technical Excellence Through Inclusive Collaboration**

## Our Mission

The OpenAPI AI Agents Standard (OAAS) project establishes universal interoperability protocols for AI agent ecosystems. We are committed to maintaining the highest technical standards while fostering an inclusive environment that welcomes contributions from diverse perspectives and expertise levels.

## Technical Standards and Professional Conduct

### Core Principles

1. **Technical Rigor**: All contributions must meet production-quality standards with comprehensive documentation, testing, and validation
2. **Interoperability Focus**: Solutions must bridge frameworks rather than create vendor lock-in
3. **Evidence-Based Decisions**: Technical choices must be supported by benchmarks, research, or real-world implementation data
4. **Security First**: All implementations must follow secure coding practices and enterprise security standards
5. **Performance Accountability**: Code must include performance metrics and optimization considerations

### Professional Communication Standards

**Encouraged Behaviors:**
- **Technical Precision**: Use specific technical terminology and provide concrete examples
- **Constructive Code Review**: Focus on code quality, security implications, and performance considerations
- **Documentation Excellence**: Maintain comprehensive technical documentation with examples and integration guides
- **Cross-Framework Expertise**: Respect and leverage knowledge across AI frameworks (MCP, LangChain, CrewAI, etc.)
- **Enterprise Perspective**: Consider production deployment, compliance, and governance requirements

**Prohibited Behaviors:**
- **Inadequate Technical Justification**: Proposing changes without performance data, security analysis, or compatibility assessment
- **Framework Bias**: Dismissing solutions based solely on framework preferences without technical merit
- **Security Negligence**: Ignoring security implications or compliance requirements in contributions
- **Documentation Deficiency**: Submitting code without adequate documentation, tests, or integration examples
- **Performance Ignorance**: Introducing performance regressions without mitigation strategies

### Compliance and Standards Enforcement

**Technical Review Process:**
1. **Specification Compliance**: All contributions must pass OAAS validation and comply with OpenAPI 3.1 standards
2. **Security Assessment**: Security implications must be documented and reviewed
3. **Performance Impact**: Performance benchmarks must be provided for significant changes
4. **Integration Testing**: Cross-framework compatibility must be validated
5. **Documentation Standards**: Technical documentation must meet enterprise-grade requirements

## Community Standards and Enforcement

### Technical Leadership Structure

**Technical Steering Committee** - Responsible for:
- OAAS specification evolution and governance
- Technical architecture decisions and compatibility requirements
- Security and compliance framework oversight
- Performance standards and benchmarking methodologies
- Enterprise adoption and production readiness criteria

**Domain Experts** - Specialized expertise areas:
- **Protocol Specialists**: MCP, A2A, UADP implementation experts
- **Framework Integrators**: LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, OpenAI integration specialists
- **Security Engineers**: Enterprise security, compliance, and governance experts
- **Performance Engineers**: Optimization, benchmarking, and scalability specialists
- **Standards Architects**: OpenAPI 3.1, JSON Schema, and specification design experts

### Enforcement and Review Process

**Technical Standards Violations:**
1. **Code Quality Issues**: Inadequate testing, documentation, or implementation standards
2. **Security Concerns**: Failure to follow secure coding practices or enterprise security requirements
3. **Performance Regressions**: Introducing performance issues without mitigation strategies
4. **Compatibility Breaks**: Breaking existing integrations without proper deprecation cycles
5. **Documentation Gaps**: Insufficient technical documentation or integration guides

**Resolution Process:**
1. **Technical Review**: Expert committee reviews technical concerns
2. **Collaborative Resolution**: Work with contributor to address technical issues
3. **Mentorship**: Provide guidance on technical standards and best practices
4. **Implementation Support**: Assist with complex technical requirements
5. **Quality Assurance**: Verify resolution meets technical standards

### Community Scope and Application

**Technical Community Spaces:**
- GitHub repositories and technical discussions
- Technical design documents and specification reviews
- Performance benchmarking and compatibility testing
- Security assessments and compliance audits
- Integration examples and technical documentation

**Professional Standards Apply To:**
- All technical contributions and code submissions
- Architecture decisions and specification changes
- Security and performance discussions
- Integration guides and documentation
- Community technical support and mentorship

## Technical Excellence Commitment

### Quality Assurance Standards

**All contributions must meet these technical requirements:**
- **100% Test Coverage**: Critical paths must have comprehensive test coverage
- **Security Validation**: All code must pass security analysis and vulnerability assessment
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Performance impact must be measured and documented
- **Documentation Completeness**: Technical documentation must include examples and integration guides
- **Compatibility Verification**: Multi-framework compatibility must be validated

### Enterprise Production Standards

**Production Readiness Criteria:**
- **Scalability**: Solutions must handle enterprise-scale deployments
- **Reliability**: 99.9%+ uptime requirements for critical components
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security with audit trails and compliance support
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive observability and performance monitoring
- **Governance**: Full compliance with regulatory frameworks (ISO 42001, NIST AI RMF, EU AI Act)
