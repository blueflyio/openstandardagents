- **Kubernetes**: Production-ready K8s deployments (12 configs)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting setup
- **CI/CD**: GitLab pipeline configurations

##  Key Features

- **10 Agent Types**: Support for voice, MCP, task, data, analytics, and more
- **Multi-Level Compliance**: Bronze, Silver, Gold conformance levels
- **Voice Agent Support**: STT/TTS integration with voice-MCP capabilities
- **Federation Ready**: Multi-tenant, multi-region architecture
- **Enterprise Grade**: Security, monitoring, and governance built-in

##  Quick Start

```bash
# Install the package
npm install @bluefly/open-standards-scalable-agents@0.1.9

# Run the orchestrator
npx ossa-orchestrator start

# Register an agent
npx ossa-registry register ./my-agent-manifest.yml

# Check compliance
npx ossa-compliance validate ./my-agent
```

## ⚠ Known Issues

1. **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Some strict mode errors remain (non-blocking)
2. **Jest ESM**: Test configuration needs update for ES modules
3. **MCP Types**: Minor type definition issues in MCP server
4. **Build Warnings**: Build shows warnings but produces working dist/

##  Migration Path

### Current (v0.1.9)
- Specification + Reference Implementation in single package
- Use as complete solution for agent orchestration

### Future (v0.2.0)
- Specification will be separated from implementation
- Implementation moves to `@bluefly/agent-buildkit`
- OSSA becomes pure specification standard
