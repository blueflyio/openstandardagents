# Contributing to OSSA

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OSSA! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the Open Standard for Software Agents (OSSA) - **The OpenAPI for Software Agents**.

**Built for Enterprise Adoption**: OSSA enables companies to build vendor-neutral, production-grade AI agent infrastructure. Your contributions help make OSSA the industry standard.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the issue already exists in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/blueflyio/openstandardagents/issues) (public) or [GitLab Issues](https://gitlab.com/blueflyio/ossa/openstandardagents/-/issues) (internal)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Environment details (OS, Node version, etc.)
   - Relevant logs or error messages

### Suggesting Features

1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Create an issue describing:
   - The feature and its use case
   - Why it would be valuable for the community
   - Potential implementation approach (if you have ideas)

### Submitting Changes

1. **Create a branch** from `development`:
   ```bash
   git checkout development
   git pull origin development
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, well-documented code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Run validations**:
   ```bash
   npm run validate:all  # Validate all manifests
   npm test              # Run tests
   npm run lint          # Check code style
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   - Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Example: `feat: add support for custom triggers`

5. **Push and create Merge Request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a Merge Request targeting `development` branch.

## Contribution Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(cli): add validate command
fix(schema): correct trigger validation
docs: update quickstart guide
```

### Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Use ESLint and Prettier (configured in project)
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names

### Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting
- Aim for high test coverage
- Include both unit and integration tests

### Documentation

- Update README.md if adding new features
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update examples if behavior changes
- Keep migration guides up to date

## Project Structure

### Repository Boundaries

**This repository (`openstandardagents`) contains:**
- OSSA specification (schemas, OpenAPI, documentation)
- CLI tooling (`ossa` commands)
- Reference examples (`examples/` directory)
- SDKs (TypeScript, Python)
