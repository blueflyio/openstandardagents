# QUALITY GATES - Fast/Full Split Model
# ============================================================================
# Fast gate: runs on all pushes (feature branches included)
# Full gate: runs only on MRs, main, and release/* branches
# This ensures gates never reference missing jobs

# Fast quality gate - runs on all branch pushes and MRs
# Requires: test:unit, test:lint, test:security (all use .rules:fast)
