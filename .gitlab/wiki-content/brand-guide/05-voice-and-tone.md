## Writing Guidelines

**Active vs. Passive:**

- They/Them = Generic third-party

**Contractions:**

**Numbers:**

- Use numerals for 10+
- Always numerals for technical specs

## Prohibited Language

❌ Ableist language (crazy, insane, lame)
❌ Violent metaphors (killer, crushed, decimated)
❌ Gendered language (guys, manpower, he/she)
❌ Exclusive language (obviously, clearly, simply, just)
❌ Vague intensifiers (very, really, extremely)

## Key Messages

**Primary:** "The OpenAPI for AI Agents"

**For Enterprises:** "Deploy anywhere, switch frameworks anytime, maintain compliance always."

**For Developers:** "Write once, deploy anywhere. Portable and future-proof."

**For Framework Builders:** "Build on an open standard. We provide the contract, you provide the innovation."
